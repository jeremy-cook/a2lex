# a2lex

This code serves to parse automotive .a2l files. The parser is currently
only configured to find the following primary blocks:

PROJECT
MODULE
HEADER
MEASUREMENT
CHARACTERISTIC
AXIS__DESCR

Future Work:
Add explicit test cases
Add more primary block types
Wrap primary functionality within Python3
